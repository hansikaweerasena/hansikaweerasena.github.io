Recent advances in dataflow-based CNN accelerators have enabled CNN inference in resource- constrained edge devices. These dataflow accelerators utilize inherent data reuse of convolution layers to process CNN models efficiently. Concealing the architecture of CNN models is critical for privacy and security. This paper evaluates memory-based side-channel information to recover CNN architectures from dataflow-based CNN inference accelerators. The proposed attack exploits spatial and temporal data reuse of the dataflow mapping on CNN accelerators and architectural hints to recover the structure of CNN models.

Specifically, this paper makes two important contributions. We show that the existing anonymous routing is vulnerable to machine learning (ML) based flow correlation attacks on NoCs. We propose a lightweight anonymous routing that use traffic obfuscation techniques which can defend against ML-based flow correlation attacks. Experimental studies using both real and synthetic traffic reveal that our proposed attack is successful against state-of-the-art anonymous routing in NoC architectures with a high accuracy (up to 99%) for diverse traffic patterns, while our lightweight countermeasure can defend against ML-based attacks with minor hardware and performance overhead.",

In WiNoCs, the medium access control (MAC) protocol orchestrates traffic flow across wireless hubs, shaping how traffic patterns emerge based on the protocol and the applications. In this paper, we propose a traffic analysis attack on wireless traffic governed by MAC to infer applications running in an SoC. Specifically, this paper the following major contributions. We outline a threat model involving a malicious wireless hub and a colluding application to leak traffic traces. We utilize deep learning to exploit spatiotemporal traffic features of the MAC protocol to infer applications running in the system, posing significant security and privacy risks. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed traffic analysis attack can infer applications  with high accuracy (95\\%--99\\%) across diverse WiNoC configurations and applications.

In order to design secure and trustworthy TEE-based systems, it is crucial to verify the trustworthiness of TEE implementations. Property checking is a promising avenue to guarantee that the TEE implementation satisfies the security properties. In the presence of a vulnerability, property checking will fail and provide a counterexample that can be utilized to fix the vulnerability. A major challenge in TEE property checking is that it relies on manual definition of the security properties, which can be cumbersome and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for automated generation and verification of TEE specific properties. Specifically, we leverage Finite State Machine (FSM) analysis to automatically derive and validate security properties utilizing templates.

      "text": "Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables on-chip communication between diverse cores in modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. With its shared communication fabric, NoC has become a focal point for various security threats, especially in heterogeneous and high-performance computing platforms. Among these attacks, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks occur when multiple malicious entities collaborate to overwhelm and disrupt access to critical system components, potentially causing severe performance degradation or complete disruption of services. These attacks are particularly challenging to detect due to their distributed nature and dynamic traffic patterns in NoC, which often evade static detection rules or simple profiling. This paper presents a framework to conduct topology-aware detection and localization of DDoS attacks using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by analyzing NoC traffic patterns. Specifically, by modeling the NoC as a graph, our method utilizes spatiotemporal traffic features to effectively identify and localize DDoS attacks. Unlike prior works that rely on handcrafted features or threshold-based detection, our GNN-based approach operates directly on raw inter-flit delay data, learning complex traffic dependencies without manual intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can detect and localize DDoS attacks with high accuracy (up to 99\\%) while maintaining consistent performance under diverse attack strategies. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits strong robustness across varying numbers and placements of malicious IPs, different packet injection rates, application workloads, and architectural configurations, including both 2D mesh and 3D TSV-based NoCs. Our work provides a scalable, flexible, and architecture-agnostic defense mechanism, significantly improving the availability and trustworthiness of on-chip communication in future SoC designs.",

To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach is the first attempt to investigate gain competition attacks as a security threat in optical NoCs.
